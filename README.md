# rig-extra
A companion crate for [`rig`](https://github.com/0xPlaygrounds/rig) that offers some helpful extras you may need for your agentic AI pipelines.

## Current features
- Semantic Routing: set up a semantic router with `SemanticRouter`, then add your vector store of choice (that implements `rig::vector_store::VectorStoreIndex`) and start adding some routes and agents!
- Autonomous agent abstraction
